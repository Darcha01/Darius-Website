				<p class="lead" data-aos="fade-up">I currently go to the University of Texas at San Antonio. I'm doing well with a 3.75 GPA. I want to learn software engineering or cloud engineering because I believe those are good careers with many job opportunities and good pay.
				Before Attending UTSA, I did school online through the University of Arizona, Global Campus. I primarily worked full-time while pursuing a degree in computer software technology part-time.
				The curriculum was very similar to my current one but I liked the idea of doing school full-time and working part-time. I am also the only one in my family to pursue a bachelors degree, so I am very proud of that.</p>
