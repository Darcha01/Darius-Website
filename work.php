				<p class="lead" data-aos="fade-up">After I graduated Highschool, I enlisted in the Air Force and worked as a signals analyst for 3 years before getting out and transitioning to the AF Reserves. I now work as an air transportation
				specialist but my real dream is to become a software engineer or cloud engineer. I believe working in tech is the future and it only makes sense to pursue some career in a tech-focused position. I have also been interested in tech
				since I was young. I grew up playing video games and would download mods for computer games so I figured that I would try to work for the video game industry when I grew up. I still like the idea of being a game dev, but only as a hobby and not for a corporation. So now, I am trying to pivot into a programmer position or just any tech postion that I actually like doing and get paid decently well for.</p>
