			<p class="lead" data-aos="fade-up">I am currently 24 years old and am in my final year of university. I grew up in North Carolina (lived there for 10 years), then I moved to California (lived there for 4 years), and after that I settled
			here in San Antonio for about a year. I live with my parents and my younger sister. I used to have a dog but he passed away recently (RIP Cappo).
			I used to wrestle in highschool at around 132lbs and I haven't wrestled since but I'm weighing in around 165lbs now and am looking to get into it again soon. I am in the Air Force, I'm currently a reservist but I was active duty before that. I like to stay in shape and to prove that, here is a recent physique photo of me.</p>
